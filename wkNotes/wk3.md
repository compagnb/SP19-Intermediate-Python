### Arrays
* Arrays are fundamental part of most programming languages. It is the collection of elements of a single data type (String, Int, etc.).

```python
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 20]
array = [A, B, C, D, E]
array = [Mario, Peach, Pikachu]
```

* We can create a Python array with comma separated elements between square brackets[].

```python
array = []
```

* Index is the position of element in an array. In Python, arrays are zero-indexed. This means, the element's position starts with 0 instead of 1.

```python
array = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(arr[0])
print(arr[1])
print(arr[2])
```

* Python arrays are just lists, so finding the length of an array is equivalent to finding length of a list in Python.

```python
brands = ["Coke", "Apple", "Google", "Microsoft", "Toyota"]
num_brands = len(brands)
print(num_brands)
```

* To add a new element to an array, we use append() method in Python.
```python
add = ['a', 'b', 'c']
add.append('d')
print(add)
```
